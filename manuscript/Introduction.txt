# Introduction

First, perhaps an apology. As a writer I have been developing my writing style almost exclusively within the Internet medium, particularly via blog entries, which has fundamentally altered the nature of my workflow, and perhaps even the way in which I think and organize thoughts. 

In the course of writing blog posts, one tends to develop a daily writing tendency of articulating what happens to be on one's mind at the moment, within a self-contained post. Over time, one is revisiting over and over again one's subjects of interest, repeating oneself in subsequent posts, but modifying and refining one's approach and one's expressions, given a certain subject. 

This habit must be taken in combination with daily immersion in the Internet culture itself, with its hyperconnectivity and numerous distractions. Instead of taking in information and thinking about information in a linear and systematic manner, one is taking in one's information in fragments, filling in holes where one's attention drifts, hopefully to cover the surface with a coherent body of thought, much as the relentless patter of rainfall fills its surfaces. 

In the same way, regarding my work I am endlessly refining it as my attention drifts, which may provide an interesting series of blog posts, and perhaps even an interesting way to live, but when it comes to writing a linear and structured book, which is intended to be read front to back, this tendency may pose certain complications. How to pull all of it together so it flows in a linear pathway that accounts for the book reader? 

We can argue endlessly about whether this is a good development or a bad one, and I've been personally working to reverse the tendency to distraction where I can, so I suppose that I've secretly decided that this development is a bad thing. But alas this is the current state of mind I have to work with, and perhaps attempting to write a book could be a good exercise! 

## Why?

There is a good reason I'm spouting this self-conscious nonsense. Part of my greater project is exposing the process in which ideology is generated, a process which I will be writing about thoroughly. This means relentlessly analyzing the characteristics of one's own self, and of the society one is a part of, and how one's environment, society, and self contribute to the formation of one's own ideology. One looks about today, and one can pick out much suffering that is structurally generated as the biproduct of an irresponsible application of ideolgy, which has become systematized and universally destructive through its repeated operation. 

My hope is that we can at least begin to attempt to wield our ideologies with greater responsibility by being aware of them, and coming to terms with our own nature as wielders of ideology. As soon as one declares one's belief system is non-ideological, whether it is some sort of absolutist appeal to the authority of a deity, or whether it is the declaration of total objectivity, one can expect to display all of the indicators of a true ideologue. We'll go over how this is so.
