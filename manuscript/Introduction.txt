# Introduction

First, perhaps an apology. As a writer I have been developing my writing style almost exclusively within the Internet medium, particularly via blog entries, which has fundamentally altered the nature of my workflow, and perhaps even the way in which I think and organize thoughts. So as it stands, I am not psychically equipped to be writing a book at the moment. 

In the course of writing blog posts, one tends to develop a daily writing tendency of articulating what happens to be on one's mind at the moment, within a self-contained post. Over time, one is revisiting over and over again one's subjects of interest, repeating oneself in subsequent posts, but modifying and refining one's approach and one's expressions, given a certain subject. 

This habit must be taken in combination with daily immersion in the Internet culture itself, with its hyperconnectivity and numerous distractions. Instead of taking in information and thinking about information in a linear and systematic manner, one is taking in one's information in fragments, filling in holes where one's attention drifts, hopefully to cover the surface with a coherent body of thought, much as the relentless patter of rainfall fills its surfaces. 

In the same way, regarding my work I am endlessly refining it as my attention drifts, which may provide an interesting series of blog posts, and perhaps even an interesting way to live, but when it comes to writing a linear and structured book, which is intended to be read front to back, this tendency may pose certain complications. How to pull all of it together so it flows in a linear pathway that accounts for the book reader? 

We can argue endlessly about whether this is a good development or a bad one. But alas this is the current state of mind I have to work with, and perhaps attempting to write a book could be a good exercise! 

## Why?

There is a good reason I'm spouting this self-conscious nonsense. Part of my greater project is exposing the process in which ideology is generated, a process which I will be writing about thoroughly. This means relentlessly analyzing the characteristics of one's own self, and of the society one is a part of, and how one's environment, society, and self contribute to the formation of one's own ideology. This means turning the direction of analysis not just on culture, society, environment, etc., but onto one's own self and how one's self interacts with all of these things. Why am I writing the way that I do? Why is the structure of my writing the way that it is? Why do I believe what I do, and what are my grounds for believing what I believe? And etc. 

One looks about today, and one can pick out much suffering that is structurally generated as the biproduct of an irresponsible application of ideolgy, which has become systematized and universally destructive through its repeated operation. We are torn between unself-reflective and almost solipsistic behavior, and hyper-reflective, self-conscious behavior, which, instead of improving one's ideology through feedback with the real, only manages to convolute one's ideology further with endless self-referencing and an increasing blindness to the real. 

My hope is that we can at least begin to attempt to wield our ideologies with greater responsibility by becoming aware of them and how they are generated, and by coming to terms with our own nature as wielders of ideology. As soon as one declares one's belief system is non-ideological, whether it is some sort of absolutist appeal to the authority of a deity, or whether it is the declaration of total objectivity, one can expect to take on all of the classic characteristics of a true ideologue. We'll be going over how this is so. 

## The Title

We are aware that there exist multple ideologies; indeed, we may be of the opinion that there are too many of them. But to use "reality" in the plural is a bit strange hmm? Realities? Isn't there one reality? Isn't it relativistic, and eventually self-defeating if we begin to speak of multiple realities? I say no, not in the sense we wish to speak of realities. As ideologies share causal traffic with reality, we can say that a given ideology will generate a certain reality through its application, and to study a plurality of ideologies is to study a plurality of realities which are generated in turn, but the existence of a plurality of realities does not have to force us to embrace a relativism that dissolves all truth, or which breaks down a universal reality. These are very subtle explorations of course, and we will be addressing them in the book.
